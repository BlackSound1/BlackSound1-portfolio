# BlackSound1's Portfolio Website

Upon realizing that I should probably have a portfolio, I decided to make one.
Not being a frontend -focused dev, I decided to just make a simple single-page static app using NextJS and some ShadCN components, where applicable. 

## How to Run

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- NextJS
